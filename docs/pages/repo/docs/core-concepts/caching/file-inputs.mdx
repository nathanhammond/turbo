# File Inputs

A workspace is by default considered to have been updated when any of the files in that workspace have changed. However, not every file change inside of the entire repo should result in rerunning a task. Turborepo gives you the tools to make sure that you can define every single file that matters.

## Global Files

Almost every repository has some configuration that appears at the root of the repository, and at times that impacts the behavior of child workspaces.

### `package.json` and `turbo.json`

By default Turborepo includes portions of the root `package.json`, any lockfile that may be present, and the root `turbo.json` file. These are not necessarily included as file hashes, they're processed and important pieces of data are extracted and considered separately from the precise file contents and structure.

### Specifying Additional Inputs

<Callout type="info">
  This customization is _additive_ to Turborepo's default behavior for `package.json` and `turbo.json`.
</Callout>

If there are additional files that should be considered for every single workspace, such as a root `/tsconfig.json` you should specify that in `globalDependencies`:

```jsonc filename="/turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "globalDependencies": ["tsconfig.json"],
  "pipeline": {
    "type-check": {}
  }
}
```

In this example every single task in the turborepo would be rerun in the event of a change to the root `tsconfig.json` file.

## Workspace Files

In addition to global files (which appear outside of any workspace) you may also specify which files to include on a per-workspace basis.

### `package.json` and `turbo.json`

The relevant contents of `package.json` and `turbo.json` are automatically considered for workspace hashes. This behavior is not configurable.

### Turborepo's Default Behavior

The default behavior of Turborepo is to inspect the repository and identify which files should be included in the hash calculation. Turborepo typically uses Git to identify which files to consider:

- All of the files which appear in the Git index which are children of the workspace directory.
- All of the untracked files which are children of the workspace directory and are not `.gitignore`d.

If either Git or the Git index (typically in `.git/index`) is unavailable we attempt to approximate the contents which would appear in the Git index using the following strategy:

- Include all of the files which are children of a workspace directory.
- Exclude all of the files which appear in the root `.gitignore` and the workspace directory's `.gitignore`.

<Callout type="info">
  These two approaches do not always produce identical results! The scenarios where this does not produce identical results:

- `.gitignore` files at other places in the directory hierarchy.
- Files added to the Git index which are also specified inside of a `.gitignore`.

You should aim to have both Git and the Git index of your repository available for maximum correctness.

</Callout>

### Customizing the Behavior

<Callout>
  Customizing the `inputs` immediately opts out of the default behavior. You must manually specify via `pipeline.<task>.inputs` all of the files that should be considered.
</Callout>

For some tasks it is worthwhile to reduce the number of file inputs into the task hash consideration. Very few tasks depend on the contents of `README.md`. Specifying just the files that matter can increase the frequency of cache hits.

For example, in many `build` tasks the only files that may matter might appear in the `src` directory. For `test` tasks it may depend only on files in the `src` and `test` directory. You can specify this using glob patterns passed to `pipeline.<task>.inputs`:

```jsonc filename="/turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "inputs": ["src/**"]
    },
    "test": {
      "inputs": ["src/**", "test/**"]
    }
  }
}
```

These glob patterns are relative to the relevant workspace's path, so for `build` inside of the `website` app, it would treat `/apps/website/src/**` as file inputs, and for the `utils` workspace it would consider `/packages/utils/src/**` as file inputs.

If a task this task depends on specifies file dependencies they do not need to be listed again. Dependency relationships between tasks can be used to ensure that all file dependencies are met:

```jsonc filename="/turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "inputs": ["src/**"]
    },
    "test": {
      // This task dependsOn build...
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      // ...which means that it does not need to specify "src/**" here:
      "inputs": ["test/**"]
    }
  }
}
```

This pattern can be used to save yourself from needing to repetitively enumerate a list of file globs for every single task.
